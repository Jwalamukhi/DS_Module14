# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1.Start

2.Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.

3.Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.

4.Print each element of the array during the loop.

5.After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.

6.End

## Program:
```

*/

/*#include <stdio.h>
int size = 0;
*/
void printArray(int array[], int size) {
  int i;

  for(i=0;i<size;i++)
  {
      printf("%d ",array[i]);
  }
}

```

## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
